# VesperiOS
A Linux distribution designed specifically to run games at incredible performance with some audio quirks.

## Shit's gon' be split ðŸ¥¶
That's right! VesperiOS is going to have two flavors, focused on different things and experiences. These flavors will be **VesperiOS Lunar** and **VesperiOS MoonDust**. The first one will be focused towards Hi-Res audio playback, while the second one will be focused on gaming performance.

## No x86_64 bullshit
This distro is going to be ARM64-only, and we have no plans of supporting x86_64.

## Da general roadmap
This will hopefully be completed by the end of the year... hopefully.
